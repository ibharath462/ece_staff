    <p>'Electronics' ,"one of the most unexpected disaster of modern age",said some X.Though some contemplate it to be a disaster,some view it in an alternative way.May be I am one of those who admires its offerings.The world of electronics rendered us so many devices which are superimprovised day by day.In general,electronics itself has been superimprovising as 'flexible electronics' in this modern era.
        Flexible circuits came into existence owing to the endeavour of Japanese  who hardened to bring out to this world this flexible circuit technology.It is nothing but mounting the required electronic device or electronic circuit over a flexible plastic substrate to meet the required shape.This emerging technology is made with 'photolithographic technology'.In simple it is laminating copper strips over polymer.
        Requisite of three-dimensonal electric connection(camera), flexibility during normal use(cellphones),need of limited space,need of serviceability in  rigid circuits can be met with this flexible electronics.Most commonly this is used in computer keyboards for the flexibility of keys.It is employed in the interconnection of electronic components while interconnecting directly or by means of interconnectors.What else!even in our smartphones for LCD fabrication,it plays a major role.In solar cells,this technology is employed to scale down weight and make it easy to carry.Of all it is very easy to fabricate.
        The construction involves stages of process where each material should meet the required demand.Initially base material,which lay laminate foundation in addition to the electrical and physical properties of the circuit.It satisfies all requirements(thickness,flexibility).Secondly bonding adhesives ,serves as the bonding medium for laminate.But in this thickness is different contingent on application.Last but not the least metal foil-conductive element,from which circuit path are etched.It is also of varying thickness.eg.copper coil(an excellent choice).There is existence of wrought(rolled) and electroplated foils of which rolled is preferred.
        This emerging technology would soon shrink the world of electronics in our pocket when no one find time to sleep:-)
