    <p>With advancements in the field of communication, Teleportation is more likely to become possible- where you can be in your home one moment and in your desired workplace the next moment! Yes, Physicists have transmitted an atom from one location to another inside an electronic chip.
        The findings could lead to larger electronic networks and more functional electronic chips
        This is a process by which quantum information can be transmitted from one place to another without sending a physical carrier of information. “In this process the information just appears at the destination, almost like teleportation used in the famous science fiction series Star Trek.”
        This key resource of quantum teleportation was a special type of correlation, called entanglement, shared between a sender and a receiver.
        Once entanglement is created, this ‘impossible’ information transfer becomes in fact possible according to the Laws of Quantum Mechanics.
        For the first time, the stunning process of quantum teleportation has now been used in a circuit to relay information from one corner of the sample to the other. This quantum information allows us to do teleportation with impressive speed and accuracy above what has been achievable to date.
        This research indicates that questions relating to the physics of quantum communication can be addressed using electronic circuits at microwave frequencies.
        “One may even foresee future experiments in which quantum information will be distributed over larger distances directly by microwave to optical interfaces for quantum communication”

        Also, a new method that changes the colour of single photons in a fiber optic cable could be a quantum step forward for transferring and receiving high volumes of secured data for future generations of the Internet. The objective is to convert a single photon from the color that a common quantum memory will deal with into an infrared photon that communication fibers can transmit. At the other end, it has to be converted back into the original color to go into the receiving memory to be read properly.
        In the computing world, digital data now is contained as individual bits represented by many electrons and is transmitted using pulses of infrared light containing many photons.
        In quantum computing, a futuristic technology, data might be stored in individual electrons and photons. Such quantum techniques could make data 100-percent secure from hackers and expand the ability to search large databases.
        In today’s fiber optic lines one frequency of light may carry a phone conversation, while others may carry TV channels or emails, all travelling in separate channels across the Internet. There is a need for more bandwidth, or data rate, in fibre optic networks. Hence, Researchers used two lasers to create an intense burst of dual-color light, which when focused into the same optical fiber carrying a single photon of a distinct color, causes that photon to change to a new color.
        This occurs through a process known as Bragg scattering, whereby a small amount of energy is exchanged between the laser light and the single photon, causing its color to change.
        The process, called quantum frequency translation, allows devices that talk to one another using a given color of light to communicate with devices that use a different color.
        Another big advantage of the technique is that it allows us to change the frequency of a single photon by any chosen amount.
