    <p>Solid-state switching circuits are the fundamental components of modern computers systems. It is worth spending a minute to have a glance on the effects that developments in solid-state electronics have had on the digital computer. Because only realizing difficulties make a thing appreciable.
        The first general-purpose digital computer, called ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator), was developed in the 1940s at the University of Pennsylvania. This computer was about as large as a small building, weighed about 50 tons, and contained more than 18,000 vacuum tubes. As the story is told, several college students spent their days running around the computer shop with shopping carts full of vacuum tubes because ENIAC burned about several tubes each hour.
        When the first transistor computer circuits were developed, the minicomputer was born. Minicomputers were capable of performing more advanced functions and were much smaller than any vacuum tube computer. The development of solid- state microprocessor, a complete data-processing unit constructed on a single- chip, in the 1970s led to the birth of the microcomputer. Since the birth of microcomputer, computers have been accessible and affordable for the average household.
        As computers chips became smaller and more powerful, they also became much less expensive. It has been said that if automobiles had gone through the same evolution as that of electronics, you could now buy a Rolls Royce for less than $25.00.
