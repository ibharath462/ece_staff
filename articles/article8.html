    <p>Wireless technology opened the door to space exploration. Neil Armstrong’s voyage to the moon was possible because antennas allow communication between engineered space vehicles and Earth. It’s an antenna that allows the Mars rovers to communicate with Earth from millions of miles away. To gather valuable scientific data, rovers often take measurements, pictures and video, then send them back home via radio waves at high frequencies, through their antennas.
        Currently, the Mars rovers primarily rely on what’s called indirect or relay communications. They send their data to a much larger satellite antenna, called the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which then sends it all on to Earth at high transmission rates. The frequencies of transmission are in X-band, near 8 GHz, which has a radio wavelength close to 1.5 inches. It would be nice to cut out the middleman in transmitting communication back and forth between Earth and Mars.


        At the present time, the Mars rover can relay information to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for just <a
                href="http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/technologiesofbroadbenefit/telecom/">15 minutes twice a day</a> due to orbit conditions. Allowing the Mars rover to connect directly with Earth could offer a big increase in communication time – much more data could be sent back and forth when the rover is in direct line-of-sight. A direct link would also be an advantage in the event that large satellite orbiters are no longer available.
        The challenge is to create an upgraded link that can do the job but also fit on the next upcoming Mars rover mission,
        <a href="http://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/rover/">Mars2020</a>.

        Think of an antenna as like a bucket collecting rain. The larger the bucket’s opening, the more water it can catch at any given time. The bigger it is, the more power it can receive or transmit. With more power, the data can be better extracted from the radio waves that carry pictures, video and commands. Extracting the data works similarly to modern television signals, with audio and video carried by radio waves.
        Hence, the big idea is to combine many small antennas (often called antenna elements) to make an altogether larger antenna. You can think of this antenna concept as like an organ system. An individual organ, such as the heart, can operate in and of itself. It’s when it’s combined with other organs that it can maintain a human being.

        Hence scientists have developed an antenna “organs” with a specialized geometry that looks like half of the letter “E” shape which allows the antenna to transmit and receive radio signals which are
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization">circularly polarized</a>. Basically that means the polarization of the radio waves can be oriented in a special configuration that helps reduce the effects of atmospheric gases and particles on the waves as they travel. It can also help to make sure a strong signal is maintained even if the rover itself or the antennas are moving. When enough of these antenna elements are combined together just right into what antenna engineers call an
        <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2015.2397154">array</a>, the whole can transmit and receive much greater power.
        The overall complete array should fit nicely within the required volume, whose maximum area is comparable to a standard 12-inch by 12-inch chessboard. It’s a compact way to pack the same antenna power into a much smaller space than if we relied on larger, bulkier dish antennas that have the added disadvantage of being harder to stow on the rover during flight. Thus, the future Mars rovers can successfully call home directly.
